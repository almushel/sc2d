# Simple Collision 2D
A single header 2D collision library written in C.

The goal with this library is to create a straightforward library that checks for collisions and calculates overlaps for a wide variety of shapes and lines and that's it. It should be clear from the code and the comments what each function is doing and why and for that reason hyper-optimization is not a goal here.

SIMPLE_COLLISION_2D_IMPLEMENTATION should be defined in **one** C/C++ source file before including this header.
